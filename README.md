This repository is used as a portfolio/drive to store the projects I make while learning how to code.
Currently I'm learning the C language.
All files are mine but you can feel free to reuse them for non-commercial purposes if you mention my paternity over my code.
My files will usually be in English, though it is possible that they are in Italian or French (I'm trilingual).
